## Character Concept

**Odin** - A unique vampire standing 6'11" tall, born in 1932 and embraced after extensive military service. Originally a combat engineer and demolitions specialist who served in the Korean War (1950-1953) and Vietnam War, he later transitioned to become an underground metal musician specializing in pyrotechnics.

### Key Background Elements:
- **Military Service**: Lost his father in WWII, joined the army at 18 seeking purpose. Served under Platoon Leader Hendrik and formed close bonds with fellow soldiers Balder and "Pig-faced" Jack, all of whom died in service
- **Post-Military Career**: Smooth transition to civilian life as a mechanic and underground metal musician, combining technical expertise with artistic expression
- **Core Personality**: Workaholic who uses constant activity to avoid introspection, known as a reliable "fixer" who gets things done
- **Key Relationships**: Cares for George Shoemaker (son of his deceased mentor) and maintains distant contact with his retired brother
- **Unique Value**: Combines physical intimidation, technical problem-solving, and strategic thinking - making him a valuable asset in vampiric society

The character represents a complex figure who copes with vampirism through the same mechanism he used in life: endless work and purposeful activity to avoid dwelling on loss and existential concerns.

## Usage

This vault is designed for active campaign participation, with templates and structures ready to be populated as the campaign progresses. Each file contains organized sections for easy reference during gameplay and between sessions.
